# ML-Projects
These are my Machine Learning projects
1.The project on Online Food Order Prediction is a Machine Learning Model along with Data Visualization. I did this during my internship.
  It is used to predict the likelihood of a user of the food delivery app like Swiggy or Zomato to place an order in the future.
  Thus, we can find the areas where the density of such users( who are highly likely to place an order) is high.
  More delivery partners can be deployed in such areas to fulfil the needs of the customers.
  This ensures effective utilization of resources and customer satisfaction thus boosting the profitability of the company.
